# Anytime Multi Heuristic A-star

# Abstract :
With the help of two games, Sliding 8 puzzle and Checkers we were able to understand the concept of different algortihms by applying them in these games. First we had applied A star algorithm to sliding 8 puzzle along with Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) to get the best results. Then we had applied MinMax Algorithm and Alpha Beta Pruning to the game of checkers to get the best results.
# Research Paper Reference :
We have used the mentioned research paper reference for the implementation of algorithms in the games like 8-Sliding Puzzle and Checkers.
